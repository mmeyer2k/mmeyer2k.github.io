title: A new library for symmetric encryption in CSharp
tags: [csharp]
---

I have just released my first open source .NET library called Harpocrates.
It provides strong and fool-proof symmetric encryption and built with the same principles as [dcrypt](https://github.com/mmeyer2k/dcrypt) for PHP7.

Many of the code examples I found online were flawed in at least one way.
Necessity is often the mother of invention, so I decided to tackle the problem myself.
